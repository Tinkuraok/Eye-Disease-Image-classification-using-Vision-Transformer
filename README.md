# Eye-Disease-Image-classification-using-Vision-Transformer
This project implements **Retinal ViT**, a Vision Transformer model for classifying retinal diseases from images. It uses self-attention to capture long-range dependencies, outperforming traditional CNNs in multi-class classification tasks. The model is tested on public datasets for retinal image analysis.
